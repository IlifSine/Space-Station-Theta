# Space-Station-Theta
*Please keep in mind that readme still in work*

Space Station Theta (SST) is a Open-Source 2.5D remake of Space Station 13 being created with Godot engine and C#.
### Developement progress
At the moment Space Station Theta still in **very** early stage of developement. There's no interesting gameplay for now, and there's nothing to play, because basic core game mechanics is currently being developed. SST is also lack of developers, so why don't you contribute?
